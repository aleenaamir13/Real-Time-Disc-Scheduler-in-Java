# Real-Time-Disc-Scheduler-in-Java
The project designs and implements efficient disk scheduling algorithms in operating systems, including FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, and LOOK. It develops a software module to optimize disk I/O by selecting the best algorithm based on workload, and evaluates performance via simulations to reduce seek time and improve throughput.
