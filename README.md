# Real-Time-Disc-Scheduler-in-Java
The project designs and implements efficient disk scheduling algorithms in operating systems, including FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, and LOOK. It develops a software module to optimize disk I/O by selecting the best algorithm based on workload, and evaluates performance via simulations to reduce seek time and improve throughput.

# Software:
•	JAVA Eclipse IDE

# Algorithms Implemented: 
•	First Come First Serve
•	Shortest Seek Time First
•	Scan Left 
•	Scan Right
•	C-Scan
•	Look Left
•	Look Right
•	C-Look
•	Check for Optimal
